# Google Analytics reporter

This library was created with Single Page Application architecture in mind.
Its goal is to provide as simple as possible usage of Google Analytics for SPAs.

#### Some of its features that come virtually without any "price tag" are
* Reporting of virtual navigation (based on HTML5 history object) including reporting page alias and not the actual url 
* Your REST call & navigation performance to GA - so you could monitor download, server and duration times.  
* Reports the "time to first paint" for your application - i.e. how fast the users see the first meaningful page of your application (and not a blank page)
* Reporting any redux action to GA using 'reportGoogleAnalytics' decorator (annotation)
* Easily report events / pageviews / performance values 

##Sandbox - play with our demo
[![Edit @impervaos/google-analytics-spa](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/imperva/google-analytics-spa/tree/master/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)

## Installation

Install the package
```bash
npm i @impervaos/google-analytics-spa 
```

Add the following snippet in your **index.html** _(or whatever page that is loaded first)_*** 

```html
    <!-- Google Analytics -->
    <script>
        window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;
    </script>
    <script defer src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'></script>
    <!-- End Google Analytics -->
```
Add the following in your first JSX / JS file (the root of your SPA application)

```jsx harmony
import { googleAnalyticsInit } from '@impervaos/google-analytics-spa';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

//[OPTIONAL] You dont have to use the 'history' package
// However if you do, page navigation would be traced and reported to GA automatically
const history = createBrowserHistory({ basename: '' });

//This is your GA application id.
//from https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/.../admin/property/settings (your GA property page)
const myGaApplicationId = 'UA-XXXXXXX-XX'; 
//[OPTIONAL] The name of your tracker, in case you will be using multiple trackers
const myTrackerName = 'MyTrackerName';
//report performance of pages that match this regex
//for example: if my backend requests go to http://some.com/api/v1/getMyData we would set this parameter to /.*api\/v1/
const performanceRegex = /.*/i;

//every request will also piggyback these dimensions with it
//For example: user email or any other custom dimension that you need to better track your application usage
//read more here https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829?hl=en
const customDimensions = {
                           dimension1: MyUserDetails.email,
                           dimension2: MyUserSession.id,
                           dimension3: Date.now(), //example: session start timestamp 
                         };
//[OPTIONAL] In case you would like to track your users using "GA User explorer" you need to provide GA
// with a unique identifier per user. 
// If you would not provide this identifier, google will generate a random id
//GA tracker properties (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/field-reference)  
const properties = { userId: MyUserDetails.id }; //example reporting userId

googleAnalyticsInit( myGaApplicationId,
                     myTrackerName,
                     history,
                     performanceRegex,
                     properties,
                     customDimensions
);
```

***_I decided not to embed the ga.js code, since google promissed to change it unexpectedly_
## Usage Example

```jsx harmony
import { tracker } from '@impervaos/google-analytics-spa'; 
/***
   * @param {string} error description
   * @param {boolean} isFatal
*/
function reportException(error, isFatal) {
    tracker.reportException(error, isFatal)
}

//event reporting
function reportClick() {
    try {
        performSomeComplicatedAction();
    } catch(e) {
        //in case of an error we report it to google analytics
        reportException(e.message, false);
    }    
    
    tracker.reportAction( 'MY_CATEGORY', 'BUTTON_WAS_CLICKED', 'open button clicked', 0 )
}

//manual page view reporting (i.e. reporting that navigation was done to page http://page.com/first) 
tracker.reportPage( 'my site title', 'http://page.com/first' );

//navigating to another page in the application
// @impervaos/google-analytics-spa will report navigation to page called '/virtual/path' automatically instead of reporting navigation to '/test/path'
history.push( '/test/path', gaBuildPageViewState( 'TITLE', '/virtual/path', true ) );

//react example
render() {
    return (
        <div>
           <button onClick={reportClick} />
        </div>
    );
}
